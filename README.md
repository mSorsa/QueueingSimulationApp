## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a library of steady-state parameters calculations. <br>
It primarily draws its mathematics from Banks et al. (2010) (see ref below). 

### Steady-State parameters in queueing models:
The short - but not so accurate description of what steady-state parameters is, is that it is a mathematical-analysis of how a given queueing model (system) actually works. 
A text-book example question this kind of project answers is: "Assuming 10 customers, on average, arrives in a grocery store every hour, how many counters should the store keep open in order to ensure no customer waits in line for more than 2 minutes?"
